# Change Log

## 1.0.1

- Initial Marketplace release

## 0.3.0

- Support autocompletion after `-` and `_` characters. There is a known issue where `_` does not seem to trigger as the trailing character in a class name (it works fine if you type `_` in the middle of the class though). See https://github.com/fongandrew/css-class-autocomplete/issues/1.

## 0.2.0

- Support autocomplete in JS/TS files

## 0.1.0

- Initial release
